# Purpose: Monitoring custom log directories in Kubernetes deployments.

## Explanation:
- Some applications write logs to custom directories that are not monitored by default Kubernetes logging mechanisms.
- This can lead to challenges in accessing and analyzing these logs, impacting troubleshooting efforts.

## Possible Solution :
- It involves creating a Kubernetes deployment that includes an initialization container to ensure the existence of the custom log directory and log files,
- A sidecar container responsible for monitoring the custom log directory.
